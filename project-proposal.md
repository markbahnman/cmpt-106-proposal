2D Temple Run:  
We're going to make a 2D arcade game using Python 2.7 along with Pygame. Pygame is a free collection of modules for Python
that gives the developer a set of tools to more easily create games and visual applications in Python. The game will
have multiple levels for the player to play through.....

####Criteria
1. Game runs without any major bugs
2. Degree of game completion.
3. Simple AI.
4. Most, if not all bugs in the game are not present.
5. Many members of the group are familiar with Python and Pygame by the end of the semester.
6. Multiple levels created to keep the player occupied for at least an hour.
7. Make the game customizable so the game can be further developed.
