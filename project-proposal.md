##Proposal:
We're going to make a 2D game using Python 2.7 along with Pygame. Pygame is a free collection of modules for the Python
langauge that gives the developer a set of tools to more easily create games and visual applications in Python. PyRun is going
to be a 2D running game where a character has to run through a level/map without dieing. The screen will have different level theme
based dangers on the left of the screen that will be moving to the right at various speeds. The player has to advance through the level
fast enough to outrun the deathly threats. The game will feature multiple levels varying in dificulty and visual environments/textures.

##Criteria:
1. Learn enough about Python and Pygame modules to design our game.
1. Game runs without any major bugs.
2. Degree of game completion.
4. Most, if not all bugs in the game are not present.
5. Many members of the group are familiar with Python and Pygame by the end of the semester.
6. Multiple levels created to keep the player occupied for at least an hour.

2. Logic Pro 9.1.8
3. Python 2.7
4. Python IDLE
5. Pygame 1.9.1
6. Github for project collaboration.

##Organization:
**January 31st - February 7th:** work on finalizing project proposal & core ideas, get the tools needed: Python 2.7 IDLE, Pygame, Github.
**February 7th - 28st:** Learn & Understand Pygame and Python enough to make simple programs and begin making the game.
**March 1 - March 15th:** Have a working prototype of the game with basic functionality like a single hazard and the character running on a level.
**March 15 - March 29th:** Work on the game, keep learning Pygame, document our work and code, have a working game.
**March 29 - April 12:** fixing & refining game, finishing the documentation for the game.
*If game is finished early, bonus features will be implemented.*
