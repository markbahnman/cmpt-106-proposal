PyRun:
Group Alpha is making a 2D game using Python 2.7 along with Pygame. Pygame is a free collection of modules for the Python
language that gives the developer a set of tools for creating games and visual applications in Python. PyRun is a
2D running game where the player has to run through a level/map without dying. The left of the screen will have different themed
dangers based on the level and it will be moving towards the right at various speeds. The player has to advance through the level
fast enough to outrun this oncoming threat. The game will feature multiple levels varying in difficulty and visuals.
If time permits, enemies will be added alongside better animation.

Criteria:
1. Learn enough about Python and Pygame modules to design our game.  
1. Game runs without any major bugs.  
2. Degree of game completion.  
4. Most, if not all bugs in the game are not present.  
5. Many members of the group are familiar with Python and Pygame by the end of the semester.  
6. Multiple levels created to keep the player occupied for at least an hour.

Organization:  
January 31st - February 7th: work on finalizing project proposal & core ideas, get the tools needed ready for use: Python 2.7 IDLE, Pygame, Github.  
February 7th - 28st: Learn & Understand Pygame and Python enough to make simple programs and begin making the game.  
March 1 - March 15th: Have a working prototype of the game with basic functionality like a single hazard and the character moving on a level.  
March 15 - March 29th: Work on the game, keep learning Pygame, document our work and code, have a working game.  
March 29 - April 12: fixing & refining game, finishing the documentation for the game.  
If game is finished early, bonus features will be implemented.
